# IncrementalDataProcessor

A lightweight, memory-efficient data processing library that supports incremental learning and progressive data loading for large datasets, suitable for consumer hardware.

## Problem Solved
Handles large datasets without running into memory constraints, providing real-time insights through incremental learning while ensuring high resource efficiency.

## Hardware Requirements
### Minimum Requirements
- CPU: Dual-core CPU (2 GHz or higher)
- Memory: 4 GB RAM
- Storage: 500 MB free disk space
- GPU: No GPU required

### Recommended Requirements
- CPU: Quad-core CPU (3 GHz or higher)
- Memory: 8 GB RAM
- Storage: 1 GB free disk space
- GPU: Optional: NVIDIA GTX 1050 or equivalent for enhanced performance

## Resource Management
Uses memory-mapped arrays (numpy.memmap) and data chunking to avoid loading entire datasets into memory.
Parallel processing with joblib for batch operations to utilize multiple CPU cores.

## Technical Features
- numpy
- pandas
- joblib


## Optimization Strategies
- Optimizing data loading times through efficient indexing.
- Reducing CPU load during model updates by limiting data access.


## Components
- DataLoader for incremental data chunking.
- ModelUpdater for online learning and real-time model updates.
- DiskManager for handling fallbacks to disk-based processing.


## Performance Considerations
- Memory usage under peak load should not exceed 75% of available RAM.
- Throughput: 10,000 records processed per second in optimal conditions.
